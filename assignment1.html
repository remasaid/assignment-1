                    Xavier Rudd (born 29 May 1978) is an Australian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Several of Rudd's songs incorporate
                    socially conscious themes, such as spirituality, humanity, environmentalism and the rights of Aboriginal
                    peoples.<br>
                    Rudd has become a known name at music festivals worldwide including the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the High Sierra and Wakarusa, moe.down, Summer Sonic, Lowlands, Rock Werchter among others. He has toured with artists including Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, Ben Harper, Good Old War, G. Love and Special Sauce, and Rodrigo y Gabriela.<br> Before launching his solo career Rudd began playing music as part of the band 'Xavier and the Hum'. He drew inspiration from artists such as Leo Kottke, Ben Harper, Natalie Merchant and multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, as well as music from diverse sources, such as Hawaiian and Native American music. His music first took him overseas when he traveled to Whistler, British Columbiaâ€”Rudd was in a band and would play each night after a day of snowboarding.

                    Xavier Rudd grew up in Jan Juc, near Torquay, Victoria. He attended St Joseph's College, Geelong. His maternal grandfather
                    was Dutch, born in Tilburg, a town in the Netherlands, before migrating to Australia. <br>One of his grandmothers
                    was from an Irish potato-growing family and grew up in Colac, Victoria. His father was born with Aboriginal,
                    Irish and Scottish heritage, and Rudd has Wurundjeri background, one of his great grandmothers
                    was an Aboriginal Australian, and her child (Rudd's paternal grandmother) was taken away from her.<br>
                    Rudd showed a keen interest in music growing up in a family of seven children. While primary school-aged,
                    Rudd used his mother's vacuum cleaner as a makeshift didgeridoo and he began playing his brother's guitar.<br>
                    He also played saxophone and clarinet as a child. Rudd's brother can still play guitar, but went
                    on to become an accountant in Orlando, Florida. As a child, Xavier Rudd sold recycled wood through
                    his own furniture business.[14] Immediately after finishing school, Rudd traveled to Fiji. He lived in
                    villages around the country for nine months, returning to Australia at age 19.
